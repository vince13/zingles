Dating Site
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdenoronha/dating-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdenoronha/dating-app)

A milestone project displaying capabilities in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, the Django framework.</br>
The project is a website which allows users to create accounts, edit profiles and search and engage with other users.</br>
The project makes use of Bootstrap framework for front end styling and functionality.</br>

The project can be found [here](https://dating-app-mvd.herokuapp.com/)

The project makes use of a verification system to verify or reject new profiles 
and profile images. A user account with sufficient permission is required to access
the verification system. The following user can be used for this:</br>
Username: verification</br>
Password: veripass</br>
Verification platform can be accessed [here](https://dating-app-mvd.herokuapp.com/admin/)

Verification staff can approve or reject profiles by following these steps:
1. Access the verification platform [here](https://dating-app-mvd.herokuapp.com/admin/)
2. Navigate to Profile
![Navigate to Profile](https://github.com/mdenoronha/dating-app/blob/master/media/instruction-images/verification-1.png?raw=true)

![Under actions select the appropriate action and click Google](https://github.com/mdenoronha/dating-app/blob/master/media/instruction-images/verification-3.png?raw=true)
5. Verifying Profile Images using the same process however select Profile images instead of Profile for step 2

The projects makes use of mock data and images for members

UX
---------------
The intended users are as follows:
* The main intended user is one who is looking to meet other individuals - primarily for dating
    * The site messages the 'dating' aspect of the site frequently and offers a range of functionality (explained below) to facilitate this
* Users looking to express their personal information to other users
    * Users are able to create profiles, not only displaying a range of preselected personal criteria but also a custom bio
* Users who are looking to send 'flirtatious' notifications to users but not specifically have conversations
    * The site makes use of a 'winks' feature which allows users to engage with other individuals without having to send text messages
* Users who are looking to have conversations with other users
    * The site makes use of a messaging functionality which allows users to send text messages to one another. This requires a premium subscription (explained below)
* Users looking to search through many members quickly - most likely to find a potential relationship partner
    * The site makes use of a 'quick match' feature, which allows users to view many profiles quickly, swiping to indicate an intent to engage with the user or not
* Users looking to search through many members quickly based on a range of criteria
    * All preselected profile aspects can be used in search filters, helping users to find members based on a range of criteria - most likely to match ideal romantic traits
* Users looking to search through members based on their sexuality preferences
    * In order to not display unwanted romantic interests to users, all members shown to a user match their gender preferences (and the same for the displayed user). A homosexual male user won't be shown to a female user. A heterosexual female user won't see a female user.
* Users who wish to see which profiles have viewed them
    * Views are tracked allowing users to see which members have viewed them - a desired interaction for a dating site user
* Users who wish to see which profiles have 'winked' at them - indicating a subtle romantic interest intent
    * 'Winks' are tracked allowing users to see which members have 'winked' at them - a desired interaction for a dating site user
* Users who wish to see which profiles have 'messaged' them
    * 'Messages' are tracked allowing users to see which members have 'messaged' them - a desired interaction for a dating site user
* Users who want to find members 'serious' about dating
    * The subscriptions required to engage with users (excluding winks) helps to filter out users not 'serious' about dating online 

Wireframes can be found [here](https://github.com/mdenoronha/dating-app/tree/master/media/wireframes)

The following alterations were made after the mock-up phase:
* 1 profile shown per line on mobile. 4 profiles shown per line on desktop
* Change of icons used on menu
* Change of footer shape for mobile


Features
---------------
### Existing Features ###
*Creating a User*
* Users are able to enter their username, email and password to create an account
* Usernames are unique, stopping users from creating accounts with the same details
* Using Django's authentication system, user's remain logged after leaving the site

* Members of the verification team can approve or reject profiles using the above instructions
* Members of the verification team only have sufficient permissions to make verification changes
* Users are emailed with the status of their verification

*Home*
* The logged in homepage offers a snapshot of users to encourage interaction quickly. These include most active, most recent and closest profiles (using the location information submitted on profile creation)
* The quick swipe feature allows users to swipe in a specific direction to either engage with (wink) or reject profiles
* Interaction icons (winks and messaging) are below each profile, allowing the user to quickly engage with users

*Subscribe*
* A subscribe paywall limits use of the view and messaging functionality. Users are able to use the subscribe page to select and subscribe to different payment plans

*Views*
* When viewing another profile, a view record is created (if no previous view records are unseen)
* Users can see a list of all members that have viewed them on the view page, with new view records being highlighted accordingly

*Winks*
* Users are able to create a wink record (as long as no previous wink records are unseen) by clicking the wink icon on a member's profile or profile card
* Users can see a list of all members that have winked at them on the wink page, with new wink records being highlighted accordingly

*Messages*
* Users are able to create a conversation record between themselves and another user, by sending a first message to them on the member's profile or profile card
* Messaging allows for custom text to be shown to another user
* The chat home displays all conversation a user currently has, with conversations with new messages (not sent by them) highlighted accordingly
* The specific conversation page displays all messages between themselves and another user, with new messages (not sent by them) highlighted accordingly
* A new message alert is displayed when a user receives a message whilst in a conversation with that member
![Navigate to Profile](https://github.com/mdenoronha/dating-app/blob/master/media/instruction-images/new-message.png?raw=true)
* From a specific conversation, users are able to view or wink at the member they are in discussion with

*Members*
* Users are able to view other member profiles, displaying their profile images, bio and personal details (if they are verified)
* Sexuality checks (outlined above) limit users from visiting members outside of their (or the other member's) sexual preferences
* From the members page, users are able to wink or message that specific member
* When visiting their own profile, users are able to see how their profile will appear (with engagement features disabled)
* When visiting their own profile, users are provided a link to make changes to their profile. This takes users to the edit profile page seen after registering
* Users are able to make changes to their bio, personal details as well as delete or add profile photos from the edit profile page

*Search*
* The search page lists all personal features as search options. Users are able to select attributes such as hair length, sexuality, distance, etc. to filter profiles
* Similarly to viewing members, members with contradicting sexuality preferences won't be shown
* Users are able to reset their search criteria at any time using the Reset button

*Account*
* Users are able to view their account details (passwords are not displayed) from the account page
* Users are able to edit their account details from the account page
* After subscribing, payment cards are shown on the account page
* After subscribing, any currently live subscriptions are displayed on the account page. These are removed in the subscription is no longer active
* Users are able to cancel or reactivate a subscription from the account page, updating their Stripe records
* Users are able to logout by using the link on the account page
* Users are able to delete their account (and all engagement and profile records) by using the link on the account page

### Features Left to Implement ###
* The site makes use of a reject record for the quick swipe feature, this can be expanded to allow users to 'block' certain members
* The check for new messages is not realtime and is instead an AJAX request running periodically. Under larger use this would need replacing with a realtime solution
* Users are currently not able to delete engagement records, this can be implemented
* Only three sexuality preferences and two gender options are currently available, this can be expanded to accommodate more users
* If a user's subscription has ended, the user is still premium until they try to complete a premium action - then they are downgraded. Ideally this would update on subscription end date.

Technologies Used
---------------
* Python was used extensively in the creation of the app
* The Django framework was used in creation of the app
* the django-filters package was used to facilitate the search functionality
* The Stripe platform and stripe.js is used to facilitate the subscription feature
